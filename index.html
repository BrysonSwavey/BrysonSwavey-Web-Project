<h2>What is a SARM?</h2>
<div class="main p">
<p>Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are a class of androgen receptor ligands, similar properties to anabolic agents, or steroids. The advantage of SARMs when compared to steroids are the androgen-receptor specificity, tissue selectivity, and the lack of steroid-related side effects. SARMs are designed to directly effect the desired target tissue, rather than effect multiple areas of tissue in the body. This allows for less undesirable side-effects, as well as a more specific desired effect on a target tissue.</p>
<h3>What is Mk 2866 Ostarine specifically?</h3>
<p>Ostarine is a SARM that particularly exerts its anabolic effect onto muscle tissue almost exclusively. It was designed to specifically reduce muscle wasting. There are plenty of medical uses for Ostarine, such as as well as fitness uses, such as increase of stamina, and maintenance of lean muscle tissues. It has been called the most well-rounded SARM developed so far.</p>
