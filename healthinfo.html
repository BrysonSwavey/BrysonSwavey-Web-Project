    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <div class="main p">
    <p>Ostarine attaches to proteins in the body known as androgen receptors. When ostarine binds to these receptors, it tells the muscles in the body to grow. Unlike some other chemicals that bind to androgen receptors, such as steroids, ostarine doesn't seem to cause as many side effects in other parts of the body.</p>
    <h3> What are some possible side effects?</h3>
    <p>When taken by mouth, Ostarine is possibly unsafe. Liver damage has been reported in some people taking ostarine. Other common side effects of ostarine include stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, headache, nausea, fever, heart attack, and stroke.</p>
